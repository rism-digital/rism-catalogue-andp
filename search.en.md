Pollini's works are organised into seven sections, marked with letters of the alphabet (A-G), followed by a sequential number. The first section (A) lists works for piano, the second (B) instrumental works for other ensembles. Vocal music comprises sections C, with chamber vocal music, D, with other secular vocal music, and E, with sacred music. Section F, with pedagogical works, is numerically the shortest but among the most important for the composer's reception. An appendix (section G) contains lost works and arrangements by Pollini of works by other composers.
